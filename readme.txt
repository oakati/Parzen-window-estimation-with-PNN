## EE 573 Pattern Recognition - Project 4

This project employs the use of both PNN (with and without voting scheme) and KNN algorithms to analyze a given dataset. As a preprocessing step, the dataset is first subjected to principle component analysis (PCA) and multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) methods before the classification algorithms are applied.
